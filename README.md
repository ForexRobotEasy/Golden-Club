## How It Works

The main function of the software is the `OnTick()` function. This function is called on every tick of the market and performs the following steps:

1. Gets the account balance using the constant `ACCOUNT_BALANCE`.
2. Checks if the balance is sufficient to run the software. If the balance is less than the required minimum balance, it prints a message and returns.
3. Calculates the entry point using the `CalculateEntryPoint()` function.
4. Checks if the entry price is valid. If the entry price is 0, it prints a message and returns.
5. Places a trade with the calculated entry price using the `PlaceTrade()` function.
6. Sets the stop loss for the trade using the `SetStopLoss()` function.
7. Prints the trade details including the entry price and stop loss.

The `CalculateEntryPoint()` function is responsible for calculating the entry point using 12 different strategies. This function can be implemented with the specific strategies of the trading system. In the provided code, it returns a constant entry price of 1.2345.

The `PlaceTrade()` function is responsible for executing the trade with the specified entry price. This function can be implemented with the specific trade execution logic of the trading system. In the provided code, it returns true to indicate a successful trade.

The `SetStopLoss()` function is responsible for setting the stop loss for the trade. This function can be implemented with the specific stop loss setting logic of the trading system. In the provided code, it prints the stop loss details.

The `OnStart()` function serves as the program entry point and calls the `OnTick()` function to execute the main trading logic.
